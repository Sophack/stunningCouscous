Clone the code of this repo, then install the following dependencies: 
- NPM 
- Express.js
- API
- Sequelize
- MySql

After the dependencies have been installed, user can type `npm start` to get started. Insomnia, Thunder client, or an appropriate plugin/addon should be used to enter Get/Post/Put/Delete requests. User can then use MySql to check table stats. 

## Usage
Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to the prevalence of these platforms, it is important for developers to understand the fundamental architecture of e-commerce sites.
